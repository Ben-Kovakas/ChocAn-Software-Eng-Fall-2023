Overview – 
ChocAn software program for CS200 Software Engineering and 
Design class for Fall 2023. Over the course of the semester, we completed the 
Requirements (Project 1), Analysis (Project 2), Design (Project 3), and
Implementation and Testing (Project 4) phases of the Software Development
Lifecycle (SDLC). The project implemented Secure and Agile Software 
Development processes. Project 1 – 4 assignments can be viewed under the 
Assignments folder. Solutions for Project 1 – 3 can be viewed via each 
Report.html file. The final software program can be run by the JAR under the 
release folder in Project 4.

Project1 - Requirements
This folder contains each member's individual glossary terms and UML diagrams
based off the project description. The security use case matrices and stories are also
inlcuses. Finally, the Report.html file contains the finalized versions of the software
glossary, UML diagram, security matrices, and use case descriptions.

Project2 - Analysis
This folder contains each member's individual activity diagram and stereotype class diagram.
It also contains agile updates for project 1. The activity diagrams for each use case are
included in the folder and the Report.html file, the latter of which also contains the
finalized full activity and stereotype diagrams.

Project3 - Design
This folder contains each member's individual class diagram for the whole software project.
Additionally, sequence diagrams for each use case and a finalized class diagram are seen in
the folder and the Report.html file, along with a paragraph explaining our software
design elements.

Project4 - Implementation and Testing
This folder contains multiple subfolders. '/src' contains the project's source code. 
'/header' contains the instructor-required header table. '/taskdistribution' contains the
instructor-required task distribution table. '/release' contains the executable JAR file.
'/manual' contains a brief user manual for the software product. The build.xml is not in a
subfolder, but is the ANT script for the project. Note that any extraneous text files (i.e.
'members.txt' or 'providers.txt') are there for the purposes of persistence only.
